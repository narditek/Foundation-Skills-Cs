# A0 foundational skills

# Set up and Defining variables ------------------------------------------------

# Load the the `stringr` package 
# (you'll need to install it if you haven't used it before)
# It has a variety of functions that make working with string variables easier


# Create a numeric variable `my_age` that is equal to your age
my_var_age <- 21

# Create a variable `my_name` that is equal to your first name
my_var_name <- "Nardos Tekle"

# Using multiplication, create a variable `minutes_in_a_day` that is
# equal to the number of minutes in a day
minutes_in_a_day <- 60 * 24

# Using multiplication, create a variable `hours_in_a_year` that is
# equal to the number of hours in a year
hour_in_a_year <- 24 * 365


# Working with functions -------------------------------------------------------

# Write a function `make_introduction()` that takes in two args (`name`, `age`) 
# This function should return a string value that says:
# Hello, my name is {name}, and I'm {age} years old.
# The values {name} and {age} should take on the values passed into the function 
# Make sure that proper spacing is used (e.g., you shouldn't have multiple
# spaces between words, and you should a space after a comma)
make_introduction <- function(name,age){
  return (sprintf("Hello, my name %s, and I'm %d years old",name,age))
}

# Create a variable `my_intro` by passing your variables `my_name` and `my_age`
# into your `make_introduction()` function
my_intro=make_introduction("Nardos Tekle,21")

# Using the `str_count` function, create a variable `occurrences` that stores
# the # of times the letter "e" appears in `my_intro`
occurences=str_count(my_intro,"e")

# Create a function `inches_to_cm` that converts from inches to centimeters and 
# returns the converted value in cm
inches_to_cm <-function(my.inch){
  my.inch <- readline(prompt="Enter number in inches: 30")
  my.inch <- as.integer(my.inch)
  cm <- my.inch * 2.54
  return(cm)
}

# Create a variable `inches_tall` that is your (numeric) height in inches
inches_tall=67

# Using your `inches_to_cm` function and your `inches_tall` variable, 
# create a variable `cm_tall` that is your height in centimeters
cm_tall<-inches_to_ca(inches_tall)


# Write a function `has_more_zs` to determine which of two strings contains 
# more instances of the letter "z". It should take as parameters two string
# variables, and return the argument which has more occurances of the letter "z"
# If neither phrase contains the letter "z", it should return:
# "Neither string contains the letter z."
# If the phrases contain the same number of "z"s, it should return:
# "The strings have the same number of Zs." 
# The function must work for both capital and lowercase "z"s. 
has_more_zs <- function (string1, string2) 
  stringone <-str_count(string1, "2")
  strongtwo <- str_count(string2, "2")
  'if(stringone == 0 && stringtwo == 0)
}
print("Neither string contain the letter z.")
}
switch (stringone == stringtwo)
print("The strings have the same number of Zs.")
}
switch (stringone > stringtwo)
return (string1)
switch (stringone < stringtwo)
return (string2)


# Create a variable `more_zs` by passing two strings of your choice to your
# `has_more_zs` function
more_zs<- has_more_zs ("zip", "zero")

# Write a function `remove_digits` that will remove all digits
# (i.e., 0 through 9) from all elements in a *vector of strings*.
remove_digits<_function (vec_str){
  x<-"0123456789"
  gsub("[0-9]", replacement = "", x=vec_str)}

# Demonstrate that your approach is successful by passing a vector of courses
# to your function. For example, remove_digits(c("INFO 201", "CSE 142"))
remove_digits(c("INFO201", "CSE 142"))

# Write a function `fluidConversion()` that takes in one numeric arg (`fluid_oz`) 
# that converts any number of fluid ounces to the equivalent 
# number of gallons, quarts, pints, and gills. Your function should print the 
# calculated number of gallons, quarts, pints, and gills on one line; be sure to
# add appropriate labels to the display values so the user knows what the value 
# means (e.g. if the user enters 6523 fluid ounces, you should display â€œ6523 
# fluid ounces is 50 gallon(s), 3 quart(s), 1 pint(s), and 2 gill(s)). Use the 
# following hints for your conversion: 
# There are 128 fluid ounces in a gallon.
# There are 32 fluid ounces in a quart.
# There are 16 fluid ounces in a pint.
# There are 4 fluid ounces in a gill.
# The modulo (a.k.a. remainder) operator in R is %% and will show the remainder 
# left after an integer division. 
fluidConversion(`fluid_oz`){
  gallons<-floor(fluidOz/128)
  quarts <- floor((fluidOz %% 128) / 32)
  pints <- floor(((fluidOz %% 128) %% 32) / 16)
  gills <- floor((((fluidOz %% 128) %% 32) %% 16) / 4)
}
fluidConversion(6523)

# Write a function `parks_and_rec()` that takes in two args (`weeks`, `hrs`) to 
# calculate how many episodes of the show "Parks and Rec" you can watch within a
# given time frame. The weeks arg is how many weeks they have to watch and the
# hrs arg is how many hours of TV they watch a day. Assuming that each episode 
# is 21 minutes long, how many episodes can the user watch? 
# Return the number of episodes as an numeric type.
parks_and_rec <- function(weeks,hrs){
  episodes<- (weeks*7*hrs)/21
  return(episodes)}

# Vectors ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a vector `movies` that contains the names of six movies you like
movies<-c('the lion king','narnia','spiderman','the princess bride','harry potter,'cinderella')
# Create a vector `top_three` that only contains the first three movies
# You should do this by subsetting the vector, not by simply retyping the movies
top_three<- movies [1:3]

# Using your vector and the `paste()` method, create a vector `excited` that
# adds the phrase - " is a great movie!" to the end of each element `movies`
excited <- paste (movies, "is an great movie!")

# Create a vector `without_four` by omitting the fourth element from `movies`
# You should do this using a _negative index_ 
without_four<_movies [-4]
